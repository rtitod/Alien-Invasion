Alien Invasion (a Space Invaders alternative) is an exhilarating arcade-style game that puts players in control of a sleek spacecraft navigating a horizontal battlefield. The objective is to defend against an onslaught of relentless alien foes, each armed with deadly projectiles. As the player, you have the advantage of automatic firing capabilities, but precision and timing are crucial to survive the interstellar onslaught.

The game features a total of eight distinct enemy types, each with its own unique attack patterns and strategies.
